# NFT Minter with Starton API

This project is a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minter that allows users to upload an image file and mint an NFT using the Starton API. The minted NFT is stored on the Polygon Mumbai testnet blockchain, and the image is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

## Features

- Upload an image file to mint an NFT
- View the minted NFT image and transaction details

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-minter.git
cd nft-minter
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the NFT Minter application.

3. Choose an image file using the "Choose File" button and click "NFT Minter" to mint the NFT.

4. Once the NFT is successfully minted, you will see the NFT image displayed, and a link to view the transaction details on the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

### How it Works

- The frontend is built using React.js and provides a simple user interface for uploading images and displaying the minted NFT.
- The backend is built using Express.js and handles image uploads, interacting with the Starton API to upload images to IPFS and mint NFTs on the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

### Configuration

If you wish to deploy this project to a production environment, make sure to set the appropriate environment variables or update the API keys:

- `REACT_APP_STARTON_API_KEY`: Your Starton API key (in `App.js`).
- `x-api-key`: Your Starton API key (in `server.js`).

**Note:** Be careful not to expose your API keys publicly. Use environment variables or secure methods for production deployments.

### Limitations

- The project uses the Polygon Mumbai testnet for demonstration purposes. For a production environment, you would need to configure the deployment to use the mainnet.
- The image file size is limited to 1MB due to the configuration in the backend (`upload.single("file")`). You can adjust this limit based on your requirements.

### Credits

- The Starton API is used for NFT minting and IPFS image uploads. More information can be found at [https://starton.io](https://starton.io).
